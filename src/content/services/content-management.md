### How you’ll manage your content

As you’ll have learnt from the last section, my websites use a content management system (CMS) called Decap. This will enable your content team to update information on the website as they wish, meaning no hidden fees down the line. 

If you are a business without a content team, I can help. Too often I come across attractive websites with a poor user-experience because the content hasn’t been formatted correctly. I can show you how best to structure and style content within Decap, so that you’re able to add content independently moving forward. Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.

### Need help creating content?

 If you have no content whatsoever, and would like assistance in drafting some - I’d be happy to help. Having drafted content for many sites including this one, I realised that my knowledge of the principles surrounding web design and development have proven useful. I know what type of content (text snippets, paragraphs, tables, bullet points) are suitable for which pages and even which style of website.
