### Why I don’t moved away from web-builders

###### Web-builders suffice in many scenarios, but rarely deliver secure, fast and highly interactive solutions

WordPress sites make up almost half of all websites ever, marking its significance in the history of the internet. Being 20 years old, out-of-the-box WordPress sites are not optimised for search engines (SEO) and are prone to information hacks (they made up 94% of all successful cyberattacks in 2019). WordPress developers tackle these shortfalls using plugins - there are over 59,000 plugins to choose from - crazy right? Plugins cost money, make your website run slower, and require an abundance of research.

Squarespace has emerged as a popular, design-focused solution. Users can choose from a library of attractive themes and will be guaranteed a website that looks nice. Their sites are more secure and SEO friendly. Unfortunately, having themes at the click of a button means your website has to lug around lots of unused code, and in turn, results in notoriously slow load-times. Don’t just take my word for it - explore this PageSpeed [report ](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-www-zafawines-com/2q7wsh2mp6?form_factor=mobile)for this wine vendor’s Squarespace site - a shocking 31/100 performance rating.

Undoubtedly the biggest drawback of “web-builders” like WordPress, Squarespace and Wix is that they’re not smart-device friendly. If a user wants to browse the sections of your site, they have to reload each new page, creating a clunky user experience familiar to us all. 

You might want to update information dynamically - take this site for instance where you can switch between Services without having to reload - this wouldn’t be possible using a web-builder. In a world where device users demand a seamless experience, this feature is increasingly in-demand.

### How I develop websites

###### **My websites are hand-coded using powerful modern tools like React and Astro. Read on to learn about how these tools will make your website better**

React is a state-of-the-art web development tool, created by Facebook, that allows users to change what information they see interactively without having to navigate to a new URL. This is useful for many reasons; interactivity keeps the user interested; it prevents overwhelming users with too many pages; and it allows users to browse content faster - all of which prevent the loss of traffic. All sounding a bit technical? Take a look at some of the companies currently using React:

Astro is a web-framework (think WordPress) that allows you to create lightning fast websites. What makes it so fast? Well, images, videos and interactive elements are what make websites slow. With Astro, these elements only load once the user has scrolled to them, instead of at initial page load, as with WordPress, Squarespace and so on. The result is extremely zippy load times - look at my site’s PageSpeed report, for instance. If you followed the link you probably noticed that the SEO metrics are sky-high too. This is a built-in feature of Astro, meaning that your website will rank highly on Google without the need for plugins or third-party help.

When I build your website, I integrate a content management system called Decap. This means that you can update the site’s content freely whenever you please.
