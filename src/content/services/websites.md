### How I develop websites

###### **My websites are hand-coded using powerful modern tools like React and Astro. Read on to learn about how these tools will make your website better**

React is a state-of-the-art web development tool, created by Facebook, that allows users to change what information they see interactively without ever having to leave the page. This is useful for many reasons; the interactivity keeps your content interesting; it prevents overwhelming users with too many pages; and it allows users to browse content faster - all of which prevent the loss of website traffic. All sounding a bit technical? Take a look at some of the companies currently using react:

**You’re in good company.** 

Astro is a web-framework (think WordPress) that allows you to create lightning fast websites. What makes it so fast? Well, images, videos and interactive elements are what make websites slow. With Astro, these elements only load once the user has scrolled to them, instead of at initial page load, as with WordPress, Squarespace and so on. The result is extremely zippy load times - look at my site’s PageSpeed report, for instance. If you followed the link you probably noticed that the SEO metrics are sky-high too. This is a built-in feature of Astro, meaning that your website will rank highly on Google without the need for plugins or third-party help.

When I build your website, I integrate a content management system called Decap. This means that you can update the site’s content freely whenever you please.
