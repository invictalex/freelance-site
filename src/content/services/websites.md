### How I develop web-apps

###### My websites are hand-coded using powerful modern tools like React and Astro. Read on to learn about how these tools will make your website better

React is a *state-of-the-art* web development tool, created by Facebook, that allows users to change what information they see interactively without having to navigate to a new page. This is useful for many reasons; interactivity keeps the user interested; it prevents overwhelming users with too many pages; and it allows users to browse content faster - all of which prevent the loss of traffic. All sounding a bit technical? Take a look at some of the companies currently using React:

Astro is a web-framework (think WordPress) that allows you to create lightning fast websites. What makes it so fast? Well, images, videos and interactive elements slow websites down. With Astro, these elements only load once the user has scrolled to them, instead of at initial page load, as with WordPress, Squarespace and so on. The result is extremely zippy load times - look at my site’s [PageSpeed report](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-alexchristodoulou-studio/kiqb0hzpl2?form_factor=desktop), for instance. If you followed the link you probably noticed that the SEO metrics are maxed out. This is a built-in feature of Astro, meaning that your website will rank highly on Google without the need for plugins or third-party help.

When I build your website, I integrate a content management system called Decap. This means that you can update the site’s content freely whenever you please.
