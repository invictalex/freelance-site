## Choosing your colours

###### A company’s colours are at the epicentre of its identity. Having the right colour palette transforms you from a business into an authentic brand.

You’ll probably notice that certain industries lean toward certain colourways. Health conscious businesses often use green - which explains why McDonalds’ interior design team made the switch back in 2009. Similarly, tech firms love blue because of its connotations with inspiration and imagination - think Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, Samsung, and every iPhone button ever. I’ll find a colour combination that both embodies your message and makes your brand stand out from the rest.

Choosing a colour palette for your website is a slightly different process, and though you will likely use your brand’s core colours somewhat, there’s plenty else to consider here. In fact, UI (user interface) designers like myself draw from an extensive Color Theory when designing a prototype. For instance, I tend to work with only a small handful of highly saturated colours (like the purple and rose-red used here) in part so that they stand out, but also to avoid overwhelming the user. When picking out these primary, secondary and tertiary colours, I test their compatibility using savvy tools like [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp).

## Designing your logo

###### Creating a fitting logo is one of the most important steps in evolving a brand identity and ultimately increasing your clicks, reach and customer base.

Firstly we’ll have a conversation about who your target audience are and what they like, before I research some established brands that serve a similar audience. Crucially, the logo should be consistent with how you perceive your brand and how your customers already perceive it, so your input at this stage is paramount. Once we have agreed on a general combination of text and imagery, the next step is to design it.

Taste around logo styles does change through the years - the one constant being that a simple logo is a timeless one. Graphics should be smooth, eye-catching and uncomplicated, and usually 1-3 colours is plenty - take Apple or Nike as the benchmark. I design my logos using Adobe Illustrator, wherein I vectorise graphics so that they can be shrunk or blown up to any size without losing quality. Oftentimes, you’ll need a few different variations -  my logo packages come with a handful of options so that you’re covered on all bases from websites to business cards.
